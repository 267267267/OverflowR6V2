# OverflowR6V2
## V2 Edition 

A modified version of my old cheat https://github.com/NMan1/Rainbow-Six-Cheat.
I changed the bypass to a SSDT hook, its a inline hook a little bit modified nothing crazy though.

The cheat itself is cleaned up and reducded down to just the cheat menu no loader.

Features: 
  - Rapid fire
  - Chams
  - No recoil
  - No spread
  - Instant animations
  - Speed changer
  - Weapon fov changer
  - Player fov changer
  
The aimbot isnt implemented yet (or maybe ever).
May or may not be safe, depends on if shiteye has sigged nops beteewn the inline mov jmp rax hook.
