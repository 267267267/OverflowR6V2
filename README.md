# OverflowR6V2
## V2 Edition 

A modified version of my old cheat https://github.com/NMan1/Rainbow-Six-Cheat.
I changed the bypass to a kernel function hook, its a inline hook a little bit modified nothing crazy though.

The cheat itself is cleaned up and reducded down to just the cheat menu no loader.

Features: 
  - Rapid fire
  - Aimbot
  - Chams
  - No recoil
  - No spread
  - Instant animations
  - Speed changer
  - Weapon fov changer
  - Player fov changer
  

May or may not be safe, depends on if shiteye has sigged nops beteewn the inline mov jmp rax hook.
